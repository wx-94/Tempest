1. For the logo, please send it to us in png -  one copy with background and another copy without background 
We have 5 different branding under the roof of Monsoon group. ALl logo as attached.

2. we understand that phone calls are the main way of appointment booking, may I know if you have the numbers and percentages of appointments made through the calls and M-Style app? (An estimation will be good too if you don't have the exact figures. )
Phone call 70%, Apps 30%, of course the appointment vis apps will increase by day if the stylist can influence the customer. 
We started from 5% increased to 30%, and i believe it will work, if we continue to use the apps. The appointment through apps or website must be convenient to all staff. 

3. After the phone calls are made, I understand that the receptionist will store the appointments in a computer system, may i know what system that is? The reason why we want to find out, is to see if we can link the system you have now with the website we are building.
The appt are NOT key into any system, it's all manually written in their outlet appointment book.

4. Additionally, we will also set up an E-store, where clients can make purchases online. Can we have the price list of both products and services, so that they can be displayed on the website? (I understand that there are many products so you can take your time on this). 
We will disclose the service price, because of other competitive salons. We will still prefer customer can call us and make an enquiries. We can offer them a special price or promotion verbally. More communication, more chances. We can display the Promotion of the month only. 
* Product wise, they are several brand in-store. To encourage customer to buy online, we must have at least 15-20% off from in-store purchase. If we do E-store for products, we need to calculate the cost for delivery & MUST have a minimum spent.
We also need to take in consideration for hairstylist personal physical product sales & their commission. We need to discuss this further if we meet.

5. Lastly, I look forward to the email you will send with the stylists in each outlet. Could you also add in the outlet locations/contact numbers of the outlets/addresses and their opening hours?
