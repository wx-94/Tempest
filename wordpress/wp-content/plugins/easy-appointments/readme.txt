= How to set custom cron task for clearing reserved slots =

= How to hide service / location / worker in front end part of form? =

To do this you must create one location / worker or service and set Name that starts with underscore. For example : *_dummy*, *_location*...

= In admin panel all pages from plugin are blank? =

You have probably turned on option in PHP called asp_tags, you need to turn it off in order to plugin work properly.

= I can't edit or delete any settings? =

Your hosting is probably blocking HTTP PUT and DELETE method. You must mark option called 'Compatibility mode' in settings.

= How to set multiple slots for one combination of location, service, worker? =

To add more slots per (location, service, worker) combination just clone the existing one. For two slots you need to
have that connection twice.

</code>

width : default value 400px
scroll_off : default value off
layout_cols : default value 1

Example :
`[ea_bootstrap width="800px" scroll_off="true" layout_cols="2"]`

= How to set form in two columns? =

You can set bootstrap form in two columns with `layout_cols` option. Example :

<code>
[ea_bootstrap width="800px" scroll_off="true" layout_cols="2"]

= How to create calendar only for one worker / service / location =
If you want to have separate calendars base on worker for example. You can do that by setting default worker inside short code.
`[ea_bootstrap worker="1"]`
